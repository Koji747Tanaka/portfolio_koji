        description: `CyberOwl provides a service where clients can obtain articles optimized for SEO performance. 
        However, the process of analysing keywords on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) and evaluating articles 
        against numerous criteria was not only time-consuming but also cost the company thousands of dollars every month. 
        By leveraging Large Language Models and other Natural Language Processing techniques, 
        we've managed to automate a significant portion of the operation.`,

        including Beta functions. Furthermore, as part of the 'SEO System DX' project, we carried out prompt engineering analysis.`,

        However, this system was developed using Vue2.js, and there are many breaking changes between Vue2.js and Vue3.js. 
        As a result, I converted it to Vue3.js and introduced the system to the most recent project I worked on.`,
